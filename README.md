# About Dataset
These images depict underwater scenes marred by discarded garbage and debris polluting the oceans. Employing a preprocessing method known as Dark Prior Channel, the dataset has been enhanced to amplify image contrast, facilitating the identification and detection of the debris.

# The file structure is organized into three primary directories:

#Train Directory:

Contains 3,628 images along with their associated labels.

#Valid Directory:

Comprises 1,001 images paired with their respective labels.

#Test Directory:

Encompasses 501 images along with their labels.

The labels encompass values representing the bounding box coordinates (e.g., x-coordinate of the top-left corner, y-coordinate of the top-left corner, width, height) along with a class label.

Number of Class - 15

Class Names - ['Mask', 'can', 'cellphone', 'electronics', 'gbottle', 'glove', 'metal', 'misc', 'net', 'pbag', 'pbottle', 'plastic', 'rod', 'sunglasses', 'tire']
